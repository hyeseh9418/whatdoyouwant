This is the application to record the MD you purchased for your favorite idol singer.
As a big fan of idol group EXO, I usually buy their MD enormously.
Very few products are used for due diligence. Most people buy them for their own collection.
Idol Pandom is becoming more popular these days, and more and more fans are buying their products more than they need.
It's not easy to remember when and how much money you purchased, because your spending on it is so huge.
To write about these unusual spending and get a quick list of collections when you need them, we developed the "What you want" app.
